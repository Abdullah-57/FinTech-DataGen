## Neural Models

### 3. LSTM Forecaster

#### Theoretical Foundation
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of recurrent neural network designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. They use gating mechanisms to control information flow.

```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)     # Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)     # Input gate
C̃_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)  # Candidate values
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t         # Cell state
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)     # Output gate
h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)                   # Hidden state
```

### 4. Transformer Forecaster

#### Theoretical Foundation
Transformers use attention mechanisms to process sequences, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. The self-attention mechanism computes relationships between all positions in the sequence.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
where head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```
